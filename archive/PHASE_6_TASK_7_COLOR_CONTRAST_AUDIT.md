# Color & Contrast Audit Report (Phase 6 Task 7, Step 1)

**Date:** October 14, 2025

## Overview
This audit reviews the MeBooks UI for color and contrast issues, focusing on compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text/UI elements). The audit covers all main UI components, CSS, and theme logic.

## Key Findings

### 1. Low Contrast Text on Dark Backgrounds
- **Classes:** `text-slate-300`, `text-slate-400`, `text-slate-200`, `text-slate-500`, `text-slate-600`
- **Backgrounds:** `bg-slate-800`, `bg-slate-900`, `rgba(17,24,39,0.95)`
- **Components:**
  - `ErrorBoundary.tsx` (e.g., `text-slate-300` on `bg-slate-900`)
  - `EmptyState.tsx` (e.g., `text-white`/`text-red-400` on `bg-slate-800`)
  - `Library.tsx` (various text and background combos)
  - Toast notifications (`toast.css`)
- **Issue:** Many of these combinations are below 4.5:1 contrast ratio, especially for secondary text and muted UI elements.

### 2. Button and Focus States
- **Classes:** `hover:bg-slate-700/50`, `border-slate-700`, `border-slate-600`, `border-sky-500/50`, `bg-sky-500`, `bg-sky-600`, `text-sky-400`, `text-sky-300`
- **Issue:** Some hover/focus states and disabled buttons do not meet 3:1 contrast ratio against their backgrounds.

### 3. Hardcoded CSS Colors
- **File:** `components/toast/toast.css`
  - `color: #e6edf3; background: rgba(17,24,39,0.95);`
- **Issue:** These may be borderline for contrast, especially for users with low vision or color blindness.

### 4. Disabled and Muted States
- **Classes:** `disabled:bg-green-600/50`, `disabled:text-green-300`, `opacity-50`
- **Issue:** Disabled buttons and muted text may be too faint to meet minimum contrast.

### 5. Focus Indicators
- **Classes:** `outline`, `border`, `box-shadow` (various)
- **Issue:** Some focus indicators may not be visually distinct or may lack sufficient contrast (3:1) against adjacent colors.

## Recommendations
- Adjust all text/background color combinations to meet 4.5:1 (normal text) and 3:1 (large text/UI elements).
- Use a color contrast checker (e.g., WebAIM, axe) to verify all combinations.
- Update Tailwind config or CSS variables to use accessible color values.
- Ensure focus indicators are always visible and meet 3:1 contrast.
- Avoid using opacity alone for disabled/muted states; use accessible color pairings.

---

## Next Steps
- Fix all identified color and contrast issues in the codebase.
- Re-test with automated and manual tools.
- Document all changes and before/after examples.
