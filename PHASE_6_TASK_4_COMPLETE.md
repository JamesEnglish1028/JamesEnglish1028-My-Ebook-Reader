# Phase 6 Task 4: Focus Management - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: Complete  
**Test Results**: All 89 tests passing

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive focus management throughout the application to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements (Success Criteria 2.1.2, 2.4.1, 2.4.3, 3.2.1). Users can now navigate all modal dialogs using only the keyboard, with proper focus trapping, Escape key support, and automatic focus restoration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Skip Link Added ✅

#### App.tsx
Added "Skip to main content" link at the top of the page for keyboard users to bypass repetitive navigation:

```tsx
<a
  href="#main-content"
  className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only focus:absolute focus:top-4 focus:left-4 focus:z-50 focus:px-4 focus:py-2 focus:bg-sky-500 focus:text-white focus:rounded-md focus:font-semibold focus:shadow-lg"
>
  Skip to main content
</a>
```

**Features:**
- **Hidden by default**: Uses `sr-only` (screen reader only) utility class
- **Visible on keyboard focus**: When Tab is pressed, link appears with blue background
- **Positioned strategically**: Top-left corner, z-index 50 to appear above all content
- **Links to main landmark**: Jumps to `#main-content` (added in Task 2)
- **WCAG 2.4.1 compliant**: Provides bypass mechanism for repetitive content

### 2. Focus Trap Applied to ALL 11 Modals ✅

#### Small Modals (5)
1. ✅ **CitationModal** - Create citation with note
   - Focus trap active
   - Textarea receives initial focus
   - Escape closes modal

2. ✅ **BookmarkModal** - Add bookmark with note
   - Focus trap active
   - Textarea receives initial focus
   - Escape closes modal

3. ✅ **ConfirmModal** - Generic confirmation dialog
   - Focus trap active
   - First button receives focus
   - Escape closes modal

4. ✅ **DeleteConfirmationModal** - Delete book confirmation
   - Focus trap active
   - Cancel button receives focus
   - Escape closes modal

5. ✅ **DuplicateBookModal** - Handle duplicate books
   - Focus trap active
   - Replace button receives focus
   - Escape closes modal

#### Large Modals (6)
6. ✅ **SettingsModal** - Cloud sync settings
   - Focus trap active
   - Sign in/Sign out button receives focus
   - Escape closes modal (only when not syncing)
   - Prevents closing during sync operation

7. ✅ **ManageCatalogsModal** - Manage OPDS catalogs
   - Focus trap active
   - Tabs navigation (catalogs/registries)
   - First input field receives focus
   - Escape closes modal

8. ✅ **LocalStorageModal** - Local storage management
   - Focus trap active
   - Clear library button receives focus
   - Escape closes modal
   - Integrates with ConfirmContext for dangerous operations

9. ✅ **ShortcutHelpModal** - Keyboard shortcuts help
   - **Replaced manual focus trap** with `useFocusTrap` hook
   - Removed 55 lines of duplicate focus management code
   - Close button receives initial focus
   - Escape closes modal
   - Simplified from manual implementation

10. ✅ **OpdsCredentialsModal** - OPDS authentication
    - Focus trap active
    - Username field receives focus
    - Escape closes modal
    - Polling state handled properly

11. ✅ **NetworkDebugModal** - Network debugging (debug mode only)
    - Focus trap active
    - URL input receives focus
    - Escape closes modal

### 3. useFocusTrap Hook Implementation

All modals now use the centralized `useFocusTrap<T>` hook:

```typescript
const modalRef = useFocusTrap<HTMLDivElement>({
  isActive: isOpen,
  initialFocusRef: specificElementRef, // optional
  onEscape: onClose
});
```

**Hook Features:**
- **Generic typing**: `useFocusTrap<T extends HTMLElement>` works with any HTML element
- **Tab key trapping**: Cycles focus within modal (first → last → first)
- **Escape key handling**: Calls `onEscape` callback to close modal
- **Initial focus**: Can specify element or auto-focuses first focusable
- **Focus restoration**: Returns focus to element that opened modal
- **Cleanup**: Properly removes event listeners on unmount

### 4. Code Quality Improvements

#### ShortcutHelpModal Refactoring
- **Before**: 55 lines of manual focus trap logic
- **After**: 3 lines using `useFocusTrap` hook
- **Removed**: Duplicate `getFocusableElements` function
- **Benefit**: Consistent behavior across all modals

#### Type Safety
- All modals properly typed with `useFocusTrap<HTMLDivElement>`
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Proper ref forwarding

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance

### Success Criteria Met

#### Level A
- **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap**: ✅
  - Modal focus traps are intentional and expected
  - Can always exit with Escape key
  - No unintentional keyboard traps in application

- **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks**: ✅
  - Skip link allows bypassing repetitive navigation
  - Links to main content landmark
  - Visible on keyboard focus

- **2.4.3 Focus Order**: ✅
  - Logical focus order in all modals
  - Tab cycles through focusable elements naturally
  - Initial focus on most relevant element

#### Level AA
- **3.2.1 On Focus**: ✅
  - No unexpected context changes when elements receive focus
  - Modals don't auto-close or change unexpectedly
  - Predictable focus behavior

- **3.2.2 On Input**: ✅
  - Form inputs don't cause unexpected changes
  - Settings sync requires explicit button click
  - Catalog management requires explicit save/delete

## Testing

### Test Results
```
Test Files  36 passed (36)
Tests  89 passed (89)
Duration  5.58s
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Skip link appears when Tab is pressed from top of page
- [x] Skip link jumps to main content
- [x] All 11 modals trap Tab key within modal
- [x] Tab cycles forward through focusable elements
- [x] Shift+Tab cycles backward through focusable elements
- [x] Escape key closes all modals
- [x] Focus returns to trigger element after modal closes
- [x] Initial focus goes to appropriate element (textarea, button, etc.)
- [x] No keyboard traps in main application flow
- [x] SettingsModal prevents closing during sync
- [x] TypeScript compilation clean
- [x] No ESLint jsx-a11y warnings

### Focus Restoration Testing
- [x] Open modal from book card → close → focus returns to book card
- [x] Open settings from toolbar → close → focus returns to settings button
- [x] Open catalog management → close → focus returns to trigger
- [x] Nested modals (ConfirmModal from LocalStorageModal) → focus restores correctly

## TypeScript/ESLint

- ✅ **TypeScript**: No compilation errors
- ✅ **ESLint**: No new jsx-a11y warnings
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Generic `useFocusTrap<T>` properly typed

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **Single event listener**: One keydown listener per modal (not per focusable element)
2. **Conditional activation**: Focus trap only active when `isOpen === true`
3. **Cleanup**: Event listeners properly removed on unmount
4. **Memoization**: getFocusableElements called only when needed
5. **No polling**: Focus management is event-driven (not polling-based)

### No Performance Regressions
- All 89 tests pass with no slowdowns
- Modal open/close is instant
- No memory leaks from event listeners
- ShortcutHelpModal ~55 lines lighter

## Accessibility Improvements

### Before Task 4
- ❌ No skip link for keyboard users
- ❌ Tab key could escape modals
- ❌ Escape key didn't always close modals
- ❌ Focus not restored after modal close
- ❌ Inconsistent focus management across modals
- ❌ ShortcutHelpModal had custom implementation

### After Task 4
- ✅ Skip link provides bypass mechanism
- ✅ Tab key trapped in all 11 modals
- ✅ Escape key closes all modals consistently
- ✅ Focus restoration on all modals
- ✅ Consistent focus management via `useFocusTrap` hook
- ✅ ShortcutHelpModal uses shared implementation
- ✅ Initial focus on most relevant element
- ✅ No keyboard traps in main flow

## Technical Debt Addressed
