# Phase 6 Task 7: Color & Contrast - Documentation

**Date:** October 14, 2025

## Summary
This document details the color and contrast accessibility improvements made to MeBooks as part of Phase 6, Task 7. All changes were made to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text/UI elements).

---

## Audit Findings (Before)
- Many text/background combinations used low-contrast Tailwind classes (e.g., `text-slate-300` on `bg-slate-800`).
- Button, hover, and focus states sometimes failed the 3:1 contrast ratio.
- Disabled and muted states were too faint for some users.
- Focus indicators were not always visually distinct.

See `PHASE_6_TASK_7_COLOR_CONTRAST_AUDIT.md` for the full audit report.

## Fixes Applied (After)
- **Text Colors:**
  - Replaced `text-slate-300`, `text-slate-400`, and similar with `text-slate-100` or `text-slate-50` for higher contrast.
  - Updated error text from `text-red-400` to `text-red-500`.
- **Backgrounds:**
  - Changed `bg-slate-800` to `bg-slate-700` or lighter backgrounds for better contrast.
- **Buttons & States:**
  - Updated button and hover/focus states to use `bg-sky-600`, `bg-sky-700`, and `text-sky-400` for improved visibility.
  - Disabled states now use `bg-green-700/60` and `text-green-200`.
- **Focus Indicators:**
  - Ensured all focusable elements have visible, high-contrast outlines or box-shadows.
- **Component Examples:**
  - `EmptyState.tsx`, `Library.tsx`, and related components now use accessible color classes throughout.
